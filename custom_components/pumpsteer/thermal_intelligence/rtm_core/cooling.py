"""Time constant from free-cooling segments (cross-check / fallback for ``b``).

Approach borrowed from Ecronika/ha-preheat (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2025 Ecronika),
https://github.com/Ecronika/ha-preheat — re-implemented here on the model grid.

For every segment without heating (≥ 60 min, ≥ 8 points) the indoor temperature
relaxes towards the outdoor temperature: ``ln(T_in − mean(T_out))`` is fitted by
ordinary least squares against time; ``τ = −1/slope``. Segments are accepted when
R² > 0.5 and 0.5 h < τ < 48 h; the result is the length-weighted median.

Internal gains shift the true asymptote above ``T_out`` and bias τ: the main fit is
preferred and this estimate is only used when the main fit lacks excitation.
